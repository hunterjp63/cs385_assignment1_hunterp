Inspiration

	I have always been a fan of third person Action RPGs, I enjoy games like Dark Souls, The Witcher, and God of War. I think combat and leveling up a character are fun and engaging game mechanics. What I find most rewarding about these types of games is how they confront you with challenges, and it's your job to adapt in order to overcome that challenge. I also enjoy the fantasy and medieval themes that these games have, and I think it's an atmosphere that I want to incorporate into the project. I also enjoy the process of collecting treasures in games such as Uncharted or God of War, and I think it would be nice to add that mechanic into the game. I like how they approach story telling in Dark Souls, because the player learns about the backstory and lore through reading items and exploration rather than lengthy dialogues or cutscenes. This makes it so the focal point of the game stays on the combat, and the story complements the atmosphere. For my project, I want to provide the player with a challenge that they have to overcome, include a leveling system that rewards players for engaging with aspects of the game beside the main story, and create a charming fantasy atmosphere that includes beasts, knights, and medieval weapons.
