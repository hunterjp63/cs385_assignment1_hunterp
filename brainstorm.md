Brainstorm

If the scope is not too large, I would want to create a 3D third person Action RPG that takes place in a medieval setting. The player controls a character that has a health bar that depletes when hit by an enemy, and a stamina bar that depletes when attacking. The player has three attributes that they can level up; vitality, which increases the health bar, endurance, which increases the stamina bar, and strength, which increases the attack power. As the player defeats enemies and finds treasure in the map, they can gain XP so that they level up. The setting will be in the forest, which will lead to a castle-type building. The design of the forest points the player in the direction of the building, but it can also be explored apart from the main path to find different treasures and enemies. The enemies will include small goblins that spawn in groups, larger knights that are by themselves, both of which will spawn across the forest, and at least one boss type enemy that will be in the building. I will come up with a story that will be uncovered through the item descriptions of the treasure that you find in the map.
